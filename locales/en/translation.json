    "introduction1": "Arrakis, also known as Dune, is a desert planet that is deadly to the unprepared traveler. If the harsh sun doesn't kill you, a giant sandworm the size of a spaceship will. Or perhaps you'll be finished off by one of the locals, the Fremen. An ideal place for adventure, right?",
    "introduction2": "What makes Arrakis special is that it is the only source of spice, the most valuable substance in the universe.",
    "introduction3": "The story begins when the House of Atreides is forced by the Emperor to leave their home planet of Caladan, a lush and rainy world, and relocate to Arrakis.

Walking through the desert to find people who don't want to be found is suicide. We need a flying vehicle. Preferably one that can hover in the air like a dragonfly. What could it be?",

    "secondRiddleText": "We have an ornithopter, now we need to figure out where to find the Fremen. We know they live deep in the desert, but the desert is all around us. Back on Caladan, in the Duke's library, we found records of an ancient fortress called Qasr Usaykhim, which has long since fallen into ruin. The guards of the fortress sometimes saw barely visible figures moving on the horizon, directly opposite the gate. Perhaps these were the ones we are looking for. We must find this fortress, it will help us determine the direction in which to search.",

    "thirdRiddleText": "We have been flying west for three hours, following the sun, over a sea of sand. When huge stone formations began to appear beneath us, Duncan's intuition compels us to slow down and investigate this place more closely. We hover over the desert, but the sunlight is blinding and makes it difficult to see details, so we land on a huge flat rock that allows us to see the sand beneath it. The Fremen are masters of camouflage, but there is no dune or stone in front of us - just sand. Intuition tells us that someone is hiding right before our eyes, we just need to look closer. How many of them are there?",
